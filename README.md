# Libaries Used

# Express JS
Used for rendering and routing the website. We decided to go with JavaScript, because it includes both back and front end. We also used Node.js’s Express, as it’s a small and flexible framework that provides a lot of helpful tools for building web applications, such as routing, middleware, and templating engines. 

# Mongoose
Mongoose was used to write and retrive the data from the MongoDB database. We used Mongoose because it’s a Nosql database, an Object-Document Mapping (or ODM) library. It has an easy to learn API for defining models for data. It also includes features like validation, middleware, and query building that can simplify our code a lot.

# PUG
For the front-end, we used Pug to create the front end. It’s easy to learn, and it helped us write clean front-end code while reducing the amount of repetition. It also works well with Express, making it easy to render better content on the server-side and send it to the client.
